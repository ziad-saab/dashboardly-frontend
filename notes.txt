Questions:

updateBoards
CreateBoard, sends data
api sends data, id and data object
server-side update function not receiving body values, sends {}, why?

also check the repetition of _fetchBoards for create and update
reusing the fetchboards function but could maybe do this more efficiently
pass as prop somewhere? * FIXED, MAYBE
  ^ ask if there will be any conflicts between boardcard and home
  pass fetchboards as prop from home to boardcard, then pass that prop
  again for the update, should work?
    **used componentWillUpdate, good?
    google article says not to use this to update

change the delete boards function to also delete all bookmarks
associated with that board * FIXED

when creating a board, the form stays open with the previously-created
board's info and when submitted it creates a new board again

same for bookmarks for some reason

hitting enter to create a board or bookmark doesnt work

there is no page for bookmarks, so how to get the id?
do it on the modify modal?

click outside the modal to close it? close after creating?


fixed:
delete boards and it will update properly
